2110Pong
========

Crude implementation of a pong game for CS2110 Students

**NOTE**
This project was made using Android Studio not Eclipse, so if you're using Eclipse, chances are, you will not be able to just import it.
But, all you need are the following:
-> GameActivit.java (located in /app/src/main/java/com.pedapps.cs2110Example/)
-> activity_game.xml (located in /app/src/main/res/layout/)
-> ball.png and paddle.png (located in /app/src/main/res/drawable-hdpi/)

If you copy these guys into a brand new Eclipse project, you should be able to run it. But really, all you need to do is make sure you understand the code. If you understand it, you can employ the same technique to make your own example work.
Hope this was somewhat helpful :)
